<h3>
<p>
	Harriet Tubman, whose birth-name was Araminta Ross, was born around the years 1820-1822, as a slave in Dorchester County, Maryland.
    She was one of nine children born to Harriet Green and Benjamin Ross. When she reached the age of 5, Tubman was "rented out" as a domestic
    servant. Throughout the following several years of her childhood, she displayed "early signs of resistance" to slavery, which in turn
    left her with permanent physical injuries.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    In 1849, she escaped her plantation with her two brothers Ben and Henry, and found freedom up
    north in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. However, unsatisfied with the fact that many of her family members were
    still enslaved, she had the courage to travel back south to lead her family members and other enslaved Black people to freedom.
    She is widely believed to have led at least 70 enslaved Black people to freedom, via the Underground Railroad, a discrete "network of people, African American as well as white, offering shelter and aid to escaped enslaved people from the South."
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Tubman, an abolitionist, made connections with other abolitionists, including the famous Frederick Douglass.
    And, although this is little-known, she also fought in the Women's Suffrage movement with the familiar names of
    Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Throughout her life, Tubman has fought fearlessly for the causes she believed in,
    and she is cemented in history as an American hero.
